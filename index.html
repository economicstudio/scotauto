      <h3>Scotauto: Steem Scot Claim Automation</h3>

      <div>
        Scotauto claims all scot tokens (and steem reward) every 1-2 hour
        (frequency may be subject to change).<br />
        General instruction:
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto"
          >https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto</a

        한글 설명은 아래에 나옵니다.
      </div>
      <h3>Automatic enrollment and membership status check is now enabled!</h3>
      <div>
        As explained in
        <a
          href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto-automated-sign-up-and-member-status-check-will-be-introduced"
          >Scotauto automated sign-up and member status check will be introduced
          soon</a
        >, now sign-up and membership status check is
        <b>automatically done every 24 hours.</b><br />
      </div>

      <br />
      <h4>How to sign-up and maintain your membership?</h4>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, authorize your posting right to @scotauto (Use the tool
            below: both keychain and steemconnect are supported.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, you need to do one of the following. (but eventually claim
            frequency will depend on your contribution.)
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Follow
              <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio"
                >@blockchainstudio</a
              >
              or <a href="https://steemit.com/@gomdory">@gomdory</a>. (both will
              be better.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Use <a href="https://steemfinex.com">@steemfinex</a> (This is also
              good for you. See below. *fee should occur. Full refund
              transaction doesn't count.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        May subject to change. More ways will come soon (e.g., voting @scotauto,
        @steemfinex, @blockchainstudio, @gomdory's postings).
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <b
          >@steemfinex - low to zero fee (at most 0.25% and can even be
          zero!)</b
        >
        STEEM/STEEMP Exchange that I made!<br />
        The longer you wait, the lower fee you get. It can even be zero! Using
        @steemfinex can support my free services such as @scotauto, @scotview,
        and so on.
        <br />
        Visit
        <a href="https://steemfinex.com">https://steemfinex.com</a>
        for details.<br />
      </div>
      <br />

      <h4>Authorize scotauto</h4>
      <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username_authorize" />
      <button id="authorize">Authorize</button>
      (Using Keychain)
      <br /><br />
      Alternatively, click on
      <a href="https://api.steemconnect.com/authorize/scotauto"
        >https://api.steemconnect.com/authorize/scotauto</a
      >
      (Using Steemconnect)
      <br /><br />

      <b>Note</b>: If you fail to authorize even with a valid key, it's highly
      likely that you've already authorized your posting right to too many dapps
      (max is 40). (See details here if you're interested:
      <a
        href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/suggestion-increase-max-authority-membership"
        >[suggestion] Increase max number of dapps that a user can use]</a
      ><br /><br />

      Anyway, in that case, to use @scotauto, you should revoke one of apps that
      you no longer use. Review dapps by visiting
      https://steemd.com/@[yoursteemitid] and remove unused one. For instance,
      knacksteem or utopian was shut down while ago. You can remove knacksteem
      here: https://beta.steemconnect.com/revoke/knacksteem.app (change the last
      app name to the app you wanna remove)<br /><br />

      <h4>How to support?</h4>
      <div>
        - Follow @blockchainstudio (or @gomdory) to increase busy.pay upvoting.
        I don't think following service account such as @scotauto is so helpful
        at the moment, since there is some minimum to get upvoting from
        busy.pay.<br />
        - Vote
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio">@blockchainstudio</a>,
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@gomdory">@gomdory</a>,
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@scotauto">@scotauto</a>'s posts.<br />
        - Buy FINEX tokens at Steem Engine:
        <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=FINEX"
          >https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=FINEX</a
        >
        (Note that FINEX token has no value. It's just for donation.) @gomdory
        is another free (in a certain community due to limited resources)
        service account, I'll make some contents of the report in English
        later.<br />
        - Use @steemfinex
      </div>
      <br />

      <h4>scotauto 가입 및 회원자격 유지방법</h4>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            첫째, 위의 Authorize scotauto 툴(keychain, steemconnect 모두 지원)을
            이용하여 포스팅 권한을 @scotauto에게 위임합니다.
          </li>
          <li>
            둘째, 다음 중 하나가 필요합니다. (차후 기여도에 따른 클레임 주기
            차등화 / 보팅 배수 자동 최적화 기능 제공 등을 생각중입니다.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio"
                >@blockchainstudio</a
              >
              나 <a href="https://steemit.com/@gomdory">@gomdory</a>를 팔로우
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://steemfinex.com">@steemfinex</a>사용 (저렴한
              수수료도 본인에게도 혜택입니다. 수수료가 발생한 거래에 한합니다.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        기준은 변경될 수 있으며 보다 다양한 방법을 도입 예정입니다. 사용중지는
        아래 툴을 사용하면 됩니다.

      <h4>To stop using scotauto (revoke scotauto)</h4>
      <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username_revoke" />

      <br /><br />
      <div>
        You don't need to notify me after revoking. Without your authorization,
        there is nothing for @scotauto to do with your account.
