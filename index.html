      <h3>Scotauto: Steem Scot Claim Automation</h3>

      <div>
        Scotauto claims all scot tokens (and steem reward) every 1-2 hour
        (frequency may be subject to change).<br />
        General instruction:
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto"
          >https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto</a
        >
      </div>
      <h3>Upcoming change</h3>
      <div>
        <a
          href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto-automated-sign-up-and-member-status-check-will-be-introduced"
          >Scotauto automated sign-up and member status check will be introduced
          soon.</a
        ><br />
        In sum, you need to follow @blockchainstudio or @gomdory to maintain your free membership. (There will be a delegation option if you cannot follow.)
      </div>

      <br />

      <h4>How to support?</h4>
      <div>
        - Follow @blockchainstudio (or @gomdory) to increase busy.pay upvoting. I don't think following service account such as @scotauto is so helpful at the moment, since there is some minimum to get upvoting from busy.pay.<br />
        - Vote <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio">@blockchainstudio</a>, <a href="https://steemit.com/@gomdory">@gomdory</a>, <a href="https://steemit.com/@scotauto">@scotauto</a>'s posts.<br />
        - Buy FINEX tokens at Steem Engine: <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=FINEX">https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=FINEX</a> (Note that FINEX token has no value. It's just for donation.) @gomdory is another free (in a certain community due to limited resources) service account, I'll make some contents of the report in English later.<br />
        - Use @steemfinex
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <b>@steemfinex - low & zero fee (at most 0.25% and can even be zero!)</b> STEEM/STEEMP Exchange that I made!<br />
        The longer you wait, the lower your fee will be. It can even be zero! Using @steemfinex can support my free services such as @scotview, @scotauto, and so on.
        <br />
        Visit
        <a href="https://steemfinex.com"
          >https://steemfinex.com</a
        >
        for details.<br />
      </div>
      <br />

      <br />

      <h4>Authorize scotauto</h4>
      <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username_authorize" />
      <button id="authorize">Authorize</button>
      (Using Keychain)
      <br /><br />
      Alternatively, click on
      <a href="https://api.steemconnect.com/authorize/scotauto"
        >https://api.steemconnect.com/authorize/scotauto</a
      >
      (Using Steemconnect)
      <br /><br />

      <b>Note</b>: If you fail to authorize even with a valid key, it's highly
      likely that you've already authorized your posting right to too many dapps
      (max is 40). (See details here if you're interested:
      <a
        href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/suggestion-increase-max-authority-membership"
        >[suggestion] Increase max number of dapps that a user can use]</a
      ><br /><br />

      Anyway, in that case, to use @scotauto, you should revoke one of apps that
      you no longer use. Review dapps by visiting
      https://steemd.com/@[yoursteemitid] and remove unused one. For instance,
      knacksteem was shut down while ago (even without a proper notice.) You can
      remove knacksteem here:
      https://beta.steemconnect.com/revoke/knacksteem.app (change the last app
      name to the app you wanna remove)<br /><br />

      <h4>To use scotauto</h4>

      <div>
        After authorization, write a reply to
        <a href="https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto"
          >https://steemit.com/@blockchainstudio/scotauto</a
        ><br />
        Currently, there is no automatic enrollment process, so please be
        patient.
      </div>
      <br />

      <h4>To stop using scotauto (revoke scotauto)</h4>
      <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username_revoke" />
      <button id="revoke">Revoke</button>
      <br /><br />
      Alternatively, click on
      <a href="https://api.steemconnect.com/revoke/scotauto"
        >https://api.steemconnect.com/revoke/scotauto</a
      >
      (Using Steemconnect)
      <br /><br />
      <div>
        You don't need to notify me after revoking.
      </div>
      <br /><br />
